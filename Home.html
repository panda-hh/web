        Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said he's a no on the Build Back Better Act, effectively ending negotiations on this version of legislation that would expand the nation's social safety net.
        Manchin has always been a key holdout for the legislation, sharing concerns over certain provisions of the massive tax and spending bill and how it may exacerbate soaring inflation in the country.
        "And I cannot vote to continue with this piece of legislation. I just can't. I've tried everything humanly possible. I can't get there," he said on "Fox News Sunday." "This is a no on this legislation. I have tried everything I know to do. And the President has worked diligently. He's been wonderful to work with. He knows I've had concerns and the problems I've had and, you know, the thing that we should all be directing our attention towards the variant, a Covid that we have coming back at us in so many different aspects in different ways, it's affecting our lives again."

        Their reaction was, obviously, not positive, according to the source. One senior administration official told CNN it was "totally a surprise." Manchin informed the White House that they were the first to know and he had not told even his staff yet.
In response to criticism from progressives that Manchin was holding up the bill because he wasn't supportive, he said he supported holding a vote for the bill.
"Here's the thing, when it's time, just vote, I've been saying that. Just vote. If that's what people need to show where they are, then vote," he said on Fox News.
He added: "They've trying to make this adjustment, this adjustment, or just trying to make the adjustment for the time to fit the money or the money to fit the time, not changing our approach, not targeting things we should be doing. Making sure that people basically that truly need it are getting it. Making sure that we can do things in a much better fashion. We have things that we can do in a bipartisan way, the way the Senate is supposed to work if we'll just let it happen. Just go through the committees, let's work it."
CNN has reached out to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for comment. The White House is expected to put out a full statement later Sunday.
How Manchin got there
Manchin had previously raised multiple concerns about the legislation, which passed the Democrat-controlled House last month. He wanted to pare down the bill in several areas, including paid family leave, a methane fee on emissions from energy producers and a Medicare expansion to cover hearing costs. He was also seeking changes to some of the provisions in the tax portion of the bill.
On the climate provisions in the legislation, Manchin had been negotiating for weeks with Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman Tom Carper, a Democrat from Delaware. Sticking points have included when the program would start and when it would ramp up â€” as well as the levels of methane that companies could emit before paying fees to the Environmental Protection Agency.
He said in his statement he was concerned about what the legislation would do to the nation's electric grid.
"If enacted, the bill will also risk the reliability of our electric grid and increase our dependence on foreign supply chains. The energy transition my colleagues seek is already well underway in the United States of America," he said in his statement. "In the last two years, as Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and with bipartisan support, we have invested billions of dollars into clean energy technologies so we can continue to lead the world in reducing emissions through innovation. But to do so at a rate that is faster than technology or the markets allow will have catastrophic consequences for the American people like we have seen in both Texas and California in the last two years."
Manchin also was concerned about what the legislation would do to the nation's rising debt and soaring inflation that comes after Congress passed a sweeping stimulus bill earlier this year, as well as the bipartisan infrastructure bill.
